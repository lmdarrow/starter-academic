Around this time last year, one of my co-organizers of the Vancouver chapter of RLadies brought forward the idea of hosting a data-centric hackathon. Many members of our group had participated in hackathons, but we didn't have much experience in organizing an event of this scale. In addtion, we knew we wanted our event to be a little different from other hackathons in that it would highlight data science projects and cater to participants of all skill levels. Little did we know, we'd be pivoting the event for online participation during a pandemic. In this post, I share a few lessons learned from organizing the Vancouver Datajam. 

#### What's a Datajam?

The Vancouver Datajam is a virtual one-day, hackathon-like event where participants can develop their coding skills and meet other members of the community. The event was organized by members of several gender inclusive Vancouver-based data-oriented coding groups including RLadies, PyLadies, Women in Data Science, Women TechMakers and SFU Scientific Programming Group. The Datajam was designed to benefit first-time hackers, data scientists, and gender minorities in tech. The event consists of an evening of optional workshops, followed by a day long hack where hackers exercise what they've learned in teams. Our projects range from data analysis and visualization to machine learning and app development. Our aim is to foster a beginner-friendly environment and to increase the visibility of femme-identified individuals, WoC and gender minorities in the fields of data science and technology. 


#### Projects with Purpose

Coming up with a meaningful project is one of the most time-intensive parts of a hackathon. For the Datajam, the organizers chose to develop project prompts with accompanying data beforehand, that were then passed off to team leads to draft a project workflow. Partnering with the Ocean Wise Plastics Lab, the theme for the 2020 Datajam was "Hack for a plastic waste free future." Each of our projects touched on this theme, utilizing data such as shoreline cleanup records or citizen science plastic litter data. We were lucky to have subject matter experts in the areas of marine ecology and microplastics research to support many of our teams. 


#### Eliminate Participation Barriers

Confidence 
Lack of connections
Absurd participation requirements

Our event is open to everyone, especially those coming from marginalized backgrounds and gender minorities.


#### Get Social
