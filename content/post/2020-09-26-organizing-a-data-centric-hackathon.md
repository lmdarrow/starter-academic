Around this time last year, one of my co-organizers of the Vancouver chapter of RLadies brought forward the idea of hosting a data-centric hackathon. Many members of our group had participated in hackathons, but we didn't have much experience in organizing an event of this scale. Little did we know, we'd be pivoting the event for online participation during a pandemic. In this post, I share a few lessons learned from organizing the Vancouver Datajam. 

What's a Datajam?
