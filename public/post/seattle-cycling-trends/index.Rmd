In this post, I revisit a bike and pedestrian traffic analysis I performed several months ago in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data supporting this analysis was sourced from the [Seattle government transportation website](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-counters) and the original analysis was inspired by a R for Data Science Tidy Tuesday community event. I highly recommend checking out the [Tidy Tuesday repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) for fun, quick data challenges!    

```{r loadData}

# Original Tidy Tuesday data pull
# bike_traffic <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-02/bike_traffic.csv")

# To get a more recent look at bike traffic, data was sourced from Seattle gov on 05/17/20: 
# http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-counters


# Read in the set of counter data files and reformat with crossing label
filenames <- list.files("../blogdata/counters", pattern="*.csv", full.names=TRUE)
bikeCounterList <- lapply(filenames, read.csv)

setCrossingName <- function(table) {
  table[[2]] <- names(table)[2]
  names(table)[2] <- "crossing"
  table
}

bikeCounterList %<>% lapply(setCrossingName)

# Read in Seattle weather data
seattleWeather <- fread("../blogdata/SeattleWeatherData.csv") %>% 
  select(DATE, PRCP, TAVG)

```

```{r colorPalette}

# Custom color palette for Seattle
# We need 7 analogous colors, plus one contrasting 

seattlePalette <- c("darkslategrey", "deepskyblue4", "paleturquoise3", "darkseagreen", 
                    "darkgreen", "yellow4", "yellow", "coral4")

theme_set(theme_minimal())   
theme_update(text = element_text(family = "serif"))

```

```{r dataprep}

# Tidy bikeCounter list of data to show direction as a column, and reflect count
bikeCounterList %<>% lapply(pivot_longer, cols = -c(Date, crossing), 
                            names_to = "directionTransitType", values_to = "count")

# Desired format: date, crossing, direction, transitType, count
bike_traffic <- data.table::rbindlist(bikeCounterList, fill = FALSE)

# We see each counter has different names for the traffic movement
# Counters can be either bike + pedestrian or just bike - use this info to set the direction and transit types
bike_traffic %<>% separate(col = directionTransitType, 
                           into = c("transitType", "direction"), sep = "\\.", remove = FALSE)

bike_traffic[bike_traffic$directionTransitType %in% c("North", "South", "East", "West"), 
             c("direction", "transitType")] <- 
  c(bike_traffic[bike_traffic$directionTransitType %in% 
              c("North", "South", "East", "West"), "directionTransitType"], "bike")

bike_traffic[bike_traffic$directionTransitType == "NB", c("direction", "transitType")] <-

bike_traffic[bike_traffic$directionTransitType == "SB", c("direction", "transitType")] <-

bike_traffic %<>% select(-directionTransitType)
bike_traffic$transitType %<>% tolower()

bike_traffic$crossing = substr(bike_traffic$crossing,1,nchar(bike_traffic$crossing)-6)
bike_traffic$crossing <- gsub('\\.', ' ', bike_traffic$crossing)

```

## Seattle Bike Traffic Overview

First, let's take a look at an overview of bike traffic over time. 

```{r overview}

# Prepare data for plotting over time
bike_traffic_area <- bike_traffic %>%
    filter(monthDate >= "2014-02-01", transitType == "bike") %>%
    complete(date = seq.POSIXt(min(date), max(date), by = "hour"), crossingWrap)
bike_traffic_area$monthDate <- as.Date(floor_date(bike_traffic_area$date, "month"))

# Replace NA values with zero
bike_traffic_area[is.na(bike_traffic_area$count), "count"] = 0

# Format data to consider only bike traffic and group by the month
bike_traffic_total <- bike_traffic_area %>% 
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(monthDate) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count))

# Remove NA and one bike counter we will not consider as it is not active
bike_traffic_area <- bike_traffic_area[!is.na(bike_traffic_area$crossing),]
bike_traffic_area <- 
  bike_traffic_area[bike_traffic_area$crossing != "Chief Sealth TRL North of Thistle"  ,]

# Plot the total number of bikes by month
bike_traffic_area  %>%
  group_by(monthDate, crossing) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count/1000)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = monthDate, y = total_count)) +
    geom_area(aes(fill = factor(crossing)), alpha = .5, position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  facet_wrap(~crossing, ncol = 1) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%b %y"),
               name = "Month",
               date_breaks = "6 months") +
  labs(y = "Count (Thousands)",
       title = "Seattle Monthly Bike Traffic",
       subtitle = "February 2014 to June 2020",
       fill = "Crossing")


```

A few high-volume crossings (e.g. BGT North of NE 70th and Elliot Bay Trail) stand out, as well as some gaps in the counter data. There is also clear seasonality to this data, as expected, with rainy winters in Seattle. Using NOAA weather files for the Seattle area, we can take a quick look at the relationship between the number of bicyclists and precipitation. We consider a "rainy" day to be one with at least 0.5 inches of precipitation.

```{r weatherPlot}

# Bring weather data into the bike traffic data set by date
bike_traffic %<>% left_join(seattleWeather, by = c("dayDate" = "DATE"))

# Create weather summary
bike_traffic_weather <- bike_traffic %>%
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(dayDate) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count), TAVG = mean(TAVG), PRCP = sum(PRCP))

# Establish a rule for "rainy" in Seattle
bike_traffic_weather$wet = "No"
bike_traffic_weather <- bike_traffic_weather[!is.na(bike_traffic_weather$PRCP),]
bike_traffic_weather[bike_traffic_weather$PRCP >= 50, "wet"] = "Yes"

# Plot bike traffic and color code by weather
bike_traffic_weather %>%
  group_by(dayDate, wet) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TAVG, y = count/1000, color = wet)) +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette[c(6, 2)]) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Average Temperature (Degrees Fahrenheit)") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Bike Count (Thousands)", limits = c(0, 12)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Comparison of Daily Seattle Bike Traffic to Weather",
       color = "Daily Precipitation \n over 0.5 Inches") 
  
```

We can see a relationship between temperature and bike count, as well as a relationship between preciptiation and bike count. Bicyclist counts are noticeably higher on sunny, dry days than cold wet ones. In Seattle, rainy day bicyclists are likely regular commuters. 

Next, let's look into the hourly bike traffic patterns at different crossings to get a sense of their uses. 

```{r crossingTimeComparison}

# Create an hourly bike traffic plot
bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(year < 2020, transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(hour, wday, crossingWrap) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(crossingWrap) %>%
  mutate(pct_bike = total_count/sum(total_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = pct_bike, color = crossingWrap, fill = crossingWrap)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.25) +
  facet_grid(wday ~ crossingWrap) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(0, 6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage of Bike Crossings", 
                     labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=0.1)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  guides(color=FALSE, fill = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Seattle Bike Traffic Patterns by Hour and Weekday",
       subtitle = "Data: 2014-2019") 

```

Many bike crossing show clear commuter patterns on the weekdays, with ridership hitting its highest counts around 9 am and 5 pm on Monday - Friday. For most crossings, weekend traffic peaks around noon. 

## COVID-19 and Bike Traffic 

Seattle was the first major US city to be hit by COVID-19 starting in February 2020. How have social distancing practices impacted overall transportation trends over the last three months?

```{r covidByMonth}

# Create a subset of months to consider and label accordingly
bike_traffic_covid <- bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(month %in% 2:6)

month_names <- c(
                    `2` = "February",
                    `3` = "March",
                    `4` = "April",
                    `5` = "May",
                    `6` = "June"
                    )

# Set plotting attributes of size and alpha based on year. We want 2020 to stand out
bike_traffic_covid$year %<>% as.character()
bike_traffic_covid$size <- 0.5
bike_traffic_covid$size[bike_traffic_covid$year=="2020"] <- 1
bike_traffic_covid$alpha <- 0.5
bike_traffic_covid$alpha[bike_traffic_covid$year=="2020"] <- 1

# Plot bike traffic by month, highlighting 2020 values
bike_traffic_covid %>%
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(year, hour, month, transitType, size, alpha) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = count/1000, color = year, size = size, alpha = alpha)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(0, 6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Bike Count (Thousands)") +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette[c(1:6,8)]) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 1), guide="none") +
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.5, 1), guide="none") +
  facet_wrap(~ month, labeller = as_labeller(month_names)) +
  labs(title = "Seattle Bike Traffic Patterns in the COVID-19 Pandemic",
       color = "Year") 

```

As the pandemic worsens, we see a loss of commuting structure to the bicyclists' movement over the hours of the day. By April, overall bike count has increased significantly from previous years, with counts peaking in the afternoon. Finally, let's look at these patterns broken out by lane for the month of April, in comparison with average April ridership from 2014-2019.

```{r covidCrossing}

# Create april 2020 subset
bike_traffic_covid %<>%
  filter(transitType == "bike", year == 2020, month == 4) %>%
  group_by(year, hour, wday, crossingWrap) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(crossingWrap) %>%
  mutate(pct_bike = total_count/sum(total_count))

# Create april 2020 comparison chart
bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(month == 4, year != 2020, crossingWrap %in% bike_traffic_covid$crossingWrap) %>%
  group_by(hour, wday, crossingWrap) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(crossingWrap) %>%
  mutate(pct_bike = total_count/sum(total_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = pct_bike)) +
  geom_line(data = bike_traffic_covid, aes(x = hour, y = pct_bike), 
            color = seattlePalette[8], size = 1) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.3, fill = seattlePalette[2]) +
  facet_grid(wday ~ crossingWrap) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(0, 6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage of Bike Crossings", 
                     labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=0.1)) + 
  labs(
    title = "**April Seattle Hourly Bike Traffic Patterns**         
    <span style='font-size:11pt'> <span style='color:#00688b;'>Before</span> and
    <span style='color:#8b3e2f;'>During</span> COVID 19 Pandemic
    </span>")+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(lineheight = 1.1)
  )

```

These quick snapshots of Seattle's bike lanes show a changing picture of transportation in the midst of a pandemic. As social distancing practices make public transit or ride-hailing less recommended modes of transportation, many turn to biking for both necessary transportation and leisure.
