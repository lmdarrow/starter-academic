In this post, I revisit a bike and pedestrian traffic analysis I performed several months ago in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data supporting this analysis was sourced from the [Seattle government transportation website](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-counters) and the original analysis was inspired by a R for Data Science Tidy Tuesday community event. I highly recommend checking out the [Tidy Tuesday repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) for fun, quick data challenges!    

```{r loadData, echo = FALSE}

## Seattle Bike Traffic Overview

First, let's take a look at an overview of bike traffic over time. 

```{r overview}

bike_traffic_area <- bike_traffic %>%
    filter(monthDate >= "2014-02-01", transitType == "bike") %>%
    complete(date = seq.POSIXt(min(date), max(date), by = "hour"), crossingWrap)
bike_traffic_area$monthDate <- as.Date(floor_date(bike_traffic_area$date, "month"))


bike_traffic_area[is.na(bike_traffic_area$count), "count"] = 0
bike_traffic_total <- bike_traffic_area %>% 
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(monthDate) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count))

bike_traffic_area <- bike_traffic_area[!is.na(bike_traffic_area$crossing),]
bike_traffic_area <- bike_traffic_area[bike_traffic_area$crossing != "Chief Sealth TRL North of Thistle"  ,]

# Plot the total number of bikes by month
bike_traffic_area  %>%
  group_by(monthDate, crossing) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count/1000)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = monthDate, y = total_count)) +
    geom_area(aes(fill = factor(crossing)), alpha = .5, position = "stack") +
  # geom_line(data = bike_traffic_total, aes(x = monthDate, y = total_count/1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  facet_wrap(~crossing, ncol = 1) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%b %y"),
               name = "Month",
               date_breaks = "6 months") +
  labs(y = "Count (Thousands)",
       title = "Seattle Monthly Bike Traffic",
       subtitle = "February 2014 to June 2020",
       fill = "Crossing")


```

A few high-volume crossings (e.g. BGT North of NE 70th and Elliot Bay Trail) stand out, as well as some gaps in the counter data. There is also clear seasonality to this data, as expected, with rainy winters in Seattle. Using NOAA weather files for the Seattle area, we can take a quick look at the relationship between the number of bicyclists and precipitation. We consider a "rainy" day to be one with at least 0.5 inches of precipitation.

```{r weatherPlot}
bike_traffic %<>% left_join(seattleWeather, by = c("dayDate" = "DATE"))

bike_traffic_weather <- bike_traffic %>%
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(dayDate) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count), TAVG = mean(TAVG), PRCP = sum(PRCP))

bike_traffic_weather$wet = "No"
bike_traffic_weather <- bike_traffic_weather[!is.na(bike_traffic_weather$PRCP),]
bike_traffic_weather[bike_traffic_weather$PRCP >= 50, "wet"] = "Yes"

bike_traffic_weather %>%
  group_by(dayDate, wet) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TAVG, y = count/1000, color = wet)) +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette[c(6, 2)]) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Average Temperature (Degrees Fahrenheit)") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Bike Count (Thousands)", limits = c(0, 12)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Comparison of Daily Seattle Bike Traffic to Weather",
       color = "Daily Precipitation \n over 0.5 Inches") 
  
```

We can see a relationship between temperature and bike count, as well as a relationship between preciptiation and bike count. Bicyclist counts are noticeably higher on sunny, dry days than cold wet ones. In Seattle, rainy day bicyclists are likely regular commuters. 

Next, let's look into the hourly bike traffic patterns at different crossings to get a sense of their uses. 

```{r crossingTimeComparison}

bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(year < 2020, transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(hour, wday, crossingWrap) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(crossingWrap) %>%
  mutate(pct_bike = total_count/sum(total_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = pct_bike, color = crossingWrap, fill = crossingWrap)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.25) +
  facet_grid(wday ~ crossingWrap) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(0, 6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage of Bike Crossings", labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=0.1)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette) +
  guides(color=FALSE, fill = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Seattle Bike Traffic Patterns by Hour and Weekday",
       subtitle = "Data: 2014-2019") 

```

Many bike crossing show clear commuter patterns on the weekdays, with ridership hitting its highest counts around 9 am and 5 pm on Monday - Friday. For most crossings, weekend traffic peaks around noon. 

```{r direction, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

bike_traffic %>% group_by(hour, wday, crossingWrap, relativeDir) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = total_count/1000, color = relativeDir)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(wday ~ crossingWrap) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Bike Count (Thousands)") + 
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette[c(1,6)]) 

```

## COVID-19 and Bike Traffic 

Seattle was the first major US city to be hit by COVID-19 starting in February 2020. How have social distancing practices impacted overall transportation trends over the last three months?

```{r}
kingCountyCovid <- fread("./blogdata/us-counties.csv")
kingCountyCovid %<>% filter(county == "King")

kingCountyCovid$date <- as.POSIXct(kingCountyCovid$date, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz="PST8PDT")

bike_traffic_area <- bike_traffic %>%
    filter(dayDate >= "2020-02-01", transitType == "bike") %>%
  left_join(select(kingCountyCovid, date, cases), by = c("dayDate" = "date"))
    # complete(date = seq.POSIXt(min(date), max(date), by = "hour"), crossingWrap)

bike_traffic_area[is.na(bike_traffic_area$count), "count"] = 0
bike_traffic_total <- bike_traffic_area %>% 
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(dayDate) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count), total_cases = max(cases))

# Plot the total number of bikes by month
bike_traffic_total  %>%
  # group_by(dayDate, crossingWrap) %>%
  # summarise(total_count = sum(count/1000)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dayDate, y = total_count)) +
    # geom_area(aes(fill = factor(crossingWrap)), alpha = .5, position = "stack") +
  geom_point(data = bike_traffic_total, aes(x = dayDate, y = total_count), color = seattlePalette[2], alpha = 0.5) + 
  stat_smooth(se = FALSE, color = seattlePalette[2]) +
  geom_line(aes(x = dayDate, y = total_cases), color = seattlePalette[8], size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Cyclist Count", labels=function(x)  format(x, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE),
  sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ . * 1, name = "King County Case Count", labels=function(x)  format(x, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE))) +
  labs(x = "Date",
       title = "Seattle Bike Traffic and COVID-19 Cases",
       subtitle = "February 2020 to June 2020",
       fill = "Crossing") + 
  labs(
    title = "<span style='font-size:14pt'> Seattle <span style='color:#00688b;'>Bike Traffic</span> and
    <span style='color:#8b3e2f;'>COVID 19 Cases</span> 
    </span>")+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(lineheight = 1.1)
  )


```

```{r covidByMonth}
bike_traffic_covid <- bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(month %in% 2:6)

month_names <- c(
                    `2` = "February",
                    `3` = "March",
                    `4` = "April",
                    `5` = "May",
                    `6` = "June"
                    )

bike_traffic_covid$year %<>% as.character()
bike_traffic_covid$size <- 1
bike_traffic_covid$size[bike_traffic_covid$year=="2020"] <- 1.5
bike_traffic_covid$alpha <- 0.5
bike_traffic_covid$alpha[bike_traffic_covid$year=="2020"] <- 1

bike_traffic_covid %>%
  filter(transitType == "bike") %>%
  group_by(year, hour, month, transitType, size, alpha) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = count/1000, color = year, size = size, alpha = alpha)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(0, 6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Bike Count (Thousands)") +
  scale_color_manual(values=seattlePalette[c(1:6,8)]) +
  scale_size(range = c(0, 1), guide="none") +
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.5, 1), guide="none") +
  facet_wrap(~ month, labeller = as_labeller(month_names)) +
  labs(title = "Seattle Bike Traffic Patterns in the COVID-19 Pandemic",
       color = "Year") 

```

As the pandemic worsens, we see a loss of commuting structure to the bicyclists' movement over the hours of the day. By April, overall bike count has increased significantly from previous years, with counts peaking in the afternoon. Finally, let's look at these patterns broken out by lane for the month of April, in comparison with average April ridership from 2014-2019.

```{r covidCrossing}

bike_traffic_covid %<>%
  filter(transitType == "bike", year == 2020, month == 4) %>%
  group_by(year, hour, wday, crossingWrap) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(crossingWrap) %>%
  mutate(pct_bike = total_count/sum(total_count))

bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(month == 4, year != 2020, crossingWrap %in% bike_traffic_covid$crossingWrap) %>%
  group_by(hour, wday, crossingWrap) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(crossingWrap) %>%
  mutate(pct_bike = total_count/sum(total_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = pct_bike)) +
  geom_line(data = bike_traffic_covid, aes(x = hour, y = pct_bike), color = seattlePalette[8], size = 1) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.3, fill = seattlePalette[2]) +
  facet_grid(wday ~ crossingWrap) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour of Day", breaks = c(0, 6, 12, 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage of Bike Crossings", labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=0.1)) + 
  labs(
    title = "**April Seattle Hourly Bike Traffic Patterns**         
    <span style='font-size:11pt'> <span style='color:#00688b;'>Before</span> and
    <span style='color:#8b3e2f;'>During</span> COVID 19 Pandemic
    </span>")+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(lineheight = 1.1)
  )

```

These quick snapshots of Seattle's bike lanes show a changing picture of transportation in the midst of a pandemic. As social distancing practices make public transit or ride-hailing less recommended modes of transportation, many turn to biking for both necessary transportation and leisure. 

## Counters in the CHAZ

Seattle was also the site of some of the nation's largest organized social protests in response to the May 25th killing of George Floyd. Notably, the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) created and occupied an autonomous zone for several weeks in June within Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood.  One of the bike counters we studied in this analysis, the Broadway Cycle Track N of E Union Street, is located on the edge of this zone, providing a unique look at movement during this time. 

```{r chop, echo = FALSE}
bike_traffic_chop <- bike_traffic %>% 
  filter(month %in% 5:7, year %in% c(2020))

month_names <- c(`5` = "May",
                    `6` = "June"
                    )

bike_traffic_chop$year %<>% as.character()

# Plot bike daily bike traffic 

bike_traffic_chop %>%
  filter(crossingWrap == "Broadway\nCycle\nTrack\nNorth Of E\nUnion St") %>%
  group_by(dayDate) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dayDate, y = total_count)) +
  geom_line(color = seattlePalette[1]) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=as.POSIXct("2020-05-25 PDT"), color = seattlePalette[8], size =1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=as.POSIXct("2020-06-08 PDT"), color = seattlePalette[2], size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x=as.POSIXct("2020-05-16 PDT"), family = "serif", label="\nThe killing of George Floyd", y=380),  colour=seattlePalette[8], text=element_text(size=11)) +
  geom_text(aes(x=as.POSIXct("2020-06-17 PDT"), family ="serif", label="\nEstablishment of the CHAZ", y=380),  colour=seattlePalette[2], text=element_text(size=11)) +
  labs(y = "Daily Bike Count",
       x = "Date",
       title = "Seattle Bike Traffic in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ)",
       subtitle = "Counter Data from Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union ",
       fill = "Crossing")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "serif"))


```
As the community responds after the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, we see a sharp drop in cyclist movement near this counter. When the autonomous zone is established on June 8, 2020, movement falls close to zero. Unfortunately, we can’t see the full picture with regards to pedestrian data at this location and time. However, the bike data shows a clear change in movement patterns and gives an indication of the major impacts of this event.
