      <description>Around this time last year, one of my co-organizers of the Vancouver chapter of RLadies brought forward the idea of hosting a data-centric hackathon. Many members of our group had participated in hackathons, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in organizing an event of this scale. In addtion, we knew we wanted our event to be a little different from other hackathons in that it would highlight data science projects and cater to participants of all skill levels.</description>

      <description>In this post, I revisit a bike and pedestrian traffic analysis I performed several months ago in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data supporting this analysis was sourced from the Seattle government transportation website and the original analysis was inspired by a R for Data Science Tidy Tuesday community event. I highly recommend checking out the Tidy Tuesday repository for fun, quick data challenges!
