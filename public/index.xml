      <description>Around this time last year, one of my co-organizers of the Vancouver chapter of RLadies brought forward the idea of hosting a data-centric hackathon. Many members of our group had participated in hackathons, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in organizing an event of this scale. Little did we know, we&amp;rsquo;d be pivoting the event for online participation during a pandemic. In this post, I share a few lessons learned from organizing the Vancouver Datajam.</description>

      <description>In this post, I revisit a bike and pedestrian traffic analysis I performed several months ago in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data supporting this analysis was sourced from the Seattle government transportation website and the original analysis was inspired by a R for Data Science Tidy Tuesday community event. I highly recommend checking out the Tidy Tuesday repository for fun, quick data challenges!
Seattle Bike Traffic OverviewFirst, letâ€™s take a look at an overview of bike traffic over time.</description>
